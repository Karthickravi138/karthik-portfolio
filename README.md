# Personal Portfolio — ReactJS

A production-ready personal portfolio built with **ReactJS**, designed to present my engineering experience, projects, and technical strengths in a clear and professional manner.

This repository is intentionally structured, version-controlled, and deployed with automated CI/CD to reflect real-world engineering practices rather than a demo or sample project.
