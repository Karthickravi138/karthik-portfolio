# Personal Portfolio — ReactJS

A production-ready personal portfolio built with **ReactJS**, designed to present my engineering experience, projects, and technical strengths in a clear and professional manner.

This repository is intentionally structured, version-controlled, and deployed with automated CI/CD to reflect real-world engineering practices rather than a demo or sample project.

## 🧭 Purpose & Philosophy

This portfolio is not just a personal website — it is a **technical artifact**.

The goal of this project is to:

- Demonstrate frontend fundamentals with ReactJS
- Follow best practices around version control, deployment, and maintainability
- Act as a foundation for future backend and AI-driven integrations

The design intentionally avoids unnecessary complexity and focuses on **clarity, performance, and structure**.
